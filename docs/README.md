# Documentation Theme Customization

This repository contains documentation for a project and provides instructions on how to customize the appearance of the documentation using themes in Sphinx.

## Themes Overview

Themes in Sphinx allow you to personalize the visual style of your documentation. Sphinx comes with several built-in themes, and there are also third-party themes available for use.

## Installing a Third-Party Theme

To use a third-party theme like "Furo" for your HTML documentation, follow the steps below:

1. Install the theme using `pip` in your Python virtual environment. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install furo
   ```

2. Once the theme is installed, locate the `conf.py` file in the `docs/source` directory of your project.

3. Open the `conf.py` file in a text editor of your choice.

4. Find the `html_theme` variable in the `conf.py` file. This variable determines the theme to be used for HTML and HTML Help pages.

   ```python
   # The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages. See the documentation for
   # a list of builtin themes.
   #
   html_theme = 'furo'
   ```

5. Replace the value of the `html_theme` variable with the name of the third-party theme you want to use. In this case, set it to `'furo'` to use the Furo theme.

   ```python
   html_theme = 'furo'
   ```

6. Save the changes to the `conf.py` file.

7. Regenerate your documentation using Sphinx. Run the appropriate command in your terminal or command prompt, depending on your project setup.

8. After regenerating the documentation, open the HTML version, and you will notice that the documentation now has a new appearance based on the chosen theme.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above, you can easily customize the appearance of your documentation using themes in Sphinx. Experiment with different themes to find the one that best suits your project's needs and enhances the overall user experience.
