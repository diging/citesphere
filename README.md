# Citesphere

Citesphere is a web application that sits on top of Zotero and allows users to manage their Zotero citations. It allows users to add additional information to their citations that Zotero doesn't support such as specifying author affiliations or author URIs.

This project is under active development by the Digital Innovation Group at Arizona State University and more information will follow soon.
